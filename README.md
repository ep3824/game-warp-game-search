# Video Game Finder #

## What ##
  > This application is designed to find and display video games based on different user selected attributes.

## Why ##
  > Ideally this app is meant for people looking for new video games to play.
  > This was one of the first projects I created back in 2020, and recently I've been refactoring it for fun.

## Summary ##
  > The app finds video games by 3 different attributes, shows up to 20 games at a time that contain the 3 different attributes selected.

## Problem & Solution ##
  > It is often overwhelming trying to find new games to play. Steam is deep and vast and difficult to sort through. This app strips away the complexity.

## How to Get Started ##
  > To get started, simply fork, clone, `npm i`.
  > To start the client server, run: `npm start` from the root directory. Run the Java server with `./gradlew build`, and then `./gradlew bootRun` from the /server/demo directory.
  > Production app coming soon to https://www.ethanparent.com

## Customer Feedback ##
  > "This app helped me find Breath of the Wild for the Nintendo Switch and now I can't put it down! Thanks Ethan!"
