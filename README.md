# Video Game Finder #

## What ##
  > This application is designed to find and display video games based on different user selected attributes.

## Why ##
  > Ideally this app is meant for people looking for new video games to play.

## Summary ##
  > The app finds video games by 4 different attributes, shows up to 20 games at a time that contain the 4 different attributes selected, and then allows the user to filter those games based on console/pc.

## Problem & Solution ##
